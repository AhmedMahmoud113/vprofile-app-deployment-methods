# VProfile App Deployment Methods

Welcome to the VProfile App Deployment repository. This project demonstrates various deployment strategies for the VProfile application, showcasing my expertise in different tools and methods. Below is a detailed breakdown of each approach used, including manual setups, automation, and cloud services.

## Project Overview

The VProfile application is a multi-tiered web application designed with the following services:
- **Nginx**: Web server
- **Tomcat**: Application server
- **RabbitMQ**: Message broker
- **Memcache**: Database caching
- **MySQL**: SQL database

This repository contains different methods to deploy and configure the VProfile application, covering everything from manual provisioning to full automation with Vagrant and Ansible, as well as cloud deployment using AWS services.

## Deployment Methods

### 1. Manual Vagrant Setup
In this method, the environment and services are set up manually step-by-step using Vagrant. This approach provides a deep understanding of the infrastructure and how each service interacts within the system.

### 2. Automated Vagrant Setup
This method uses Vagrant automation scripts to streamline the deployment process. The automation eliminates manual configuration, making the process repeatable and efficient.

### 3. AWS Manual Setup
In this approach, each service is deployed and configured manually on separate AWS EC2 instances. This method highlights the ability to work with cloud services and manage infrastructure directly on AWS.

### 4. AWS Automated Setup
Using automation scripts, this method deploys the VProfile application on AWS with minimal manual intervention. It showcases my ability to leverage cloud infrastructure efficiently.

### 5. Using AWS Managed Services (RDS, Amazon MQ)
In this approach, I utilize AWS managed services like RDS for the database and Amazon MQ for the message broker. This method demonstrates a cloud-native deployment with managed services.

### 6. Terraform and Jenkins (Planned)
I am currently working on implementing this project using Terraform for infrastructure as code and Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD). This will provide a fully automated, scalable solution.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Tier Architecture**: The VProfile application is a multi-tiered application that demonstrates how different services interact within a network.
- **Automation**: Implemented automation using Vagrant and Ansible to reduce manual work and enhance deployment speed.
- **Cloud Integration**: Deployed the application on AWS, utilizing both manual setups and AWS managed services.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Planned integration of Terraform and Jenkins for automated deployment pipelines.

## Challenges and Learnings

Throughout the project, I encountered various challenges, particularly with setting up complex services and automating the process. However, each challenge was an opportunity to learn, and the solutions are documented within each method's README file.
