## Project Overview

The VProfile application is a multi-tiered web application designed with the following services:

- **Nginx**: Web server
- **Tomcat**: Application server
- **RabbitMQ**: Message broker
- **Memcached**: Database caching
- **MySQL**: SQL database

This repository contains different methods to deploy and configure the VProfile application, covering everything from manual provisioning to full automation with Vagrant and Ansible, as well as cloud deployment using AWS services.

## Deployment Methods

### 1. Manual Vagrant Setup

In this method, the environment and services are set up manually step-by-step using Vagrant. This approach provides a deep understanding of the infrastructure and how each service interacts within the system.

### 2. Automated Vagrant Setup

This method uses Vagrant automation scripts to streamline the deployment process. Automation eliminates manual configuration, making the process repeatable and efficient.

### 3. Automated Vagrant Setup with Ansible

In this method, **Ansible roles** are used in conjunction with **Vagrant** to automate the provisioning and configuration of the environment. Ansible handles the setup of services such as Nginx, Tomcat, RabbitMQ, and more, making the process fully automated.

### 4. AWS Automated Setup

Using automation scripts, this method deploys the VProfile application on AWS with minimal manual intervention. It showcases the ability to leverage cloud infrastructure efficiently.

### 5. Using AWS Managed Services (RDS, Amazon MQ)

In this approach, AWS managed services like RDS for the database and Amazon MQ for the message broker are utilized. This method demonstrates a cloud-native deployment with managed services.

### 6. Terraform and Jenkins (Planned)

Currently working on implementing this project using Terraform for infrastructure as code and Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD). This will provide a fully automated, scalable solution.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Tier Architecture**: Demonstrates how different services interact within a network.
- **Automation**: Utilizes Vagrant and Ansible to reduce manual work and enhance deployment speed.
- **Cloud Integration**: Deployed on AWS, utilizing both manual setups and AWS managed services.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Planned integration of Terraform and Jenkins for automated deployment pipelines.

## Challenges and Learnings

Throughout the project, various challenges were encountered, particularly with setting up complex services and automating processes. However, each challenge was an opportunity to learn, and solutions are documented within each method's README file.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the deployment methods:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```ruby
   git clone https://github.com/AhmedMahmoud113/vprofile-app-deployment-methods.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Desired Method:**

   ```ruby
   cd vprofile-app-deployment-methods/<method-directory>
   ```

   Replace `<method-directory>` with one of the following:

   - `manual-vagrant-setup`
   - `automated-vagrant-setup`
   - `ansible-vagrant-setup`
   - `aws-automated-setup` (when available)
   - `aws-managed-services-setup` (when available)

3. **Follow the Instructions:**

   Open the `README.md` file in the chosen directory and follow the detailed setup instructions.
